# yrdr_lawncare_app
This application was created for self-employed lawncare workers. YRDR provides a directory to keep all pertinant client information such as names, addresses, phone numbers, and even the day they are scheduled for. You can also add and remove clients from this database. There is also an estimate page that adds services together for accurate quoting. All services on this page can be updated to reflect new pricing. The expense page also has an adding list to keep track of various expenses throughout the day. In future versions this will have a customer text and e-mail billing functionality as well as an expense versus services rendered graph to show that difference.
